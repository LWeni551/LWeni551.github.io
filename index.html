         <p>
             I'm really swag and I try to convice everyone that this level of swagness exists and that I have reached it. Unfortunately, no one cares so.</p>
         <p>
             Some cool facts about me are the following:
                Im an innocent little bean
                Perfered pronowns are Lolo/Swag
                You irritate me
                I need me a cuppa tea
                These memes are over 9000
                Thats it.
         </p> 
         <p>
            If you see me at the DC or the Den, yell "Oh-Eh!" and a special reply will return.
